; THAT MAY BE CALLED BY RST 00H, 08H, 10H, 18H, 20H, 28H, 30H,
; AND 38H.  THIS IS A ONE BYTE INSTRUCTION, AND IS FUNCTIONALLY
; SIMILAR TO THE THREE BYTE INSTRUCTION 'CALL XXXX'. TINY BASIC
; WILL USE THE RST INSTRUCTION FOR THE 7 MOST FREQUENTLY USED

; *** MAIN ***
;
; THIS IS THE MAIN LOOP THAT COLLECTS THE TINY BASIC PROGRAM
; AND STORES IT IN THE MEMORY.
;
; AT START, IT PRINTS OUT "(CR)OK(CR)", AND INITIALIZES THE
; STACK AND SOME OTHER INTERNAL VARIABLES.  THEN IT PROMPTS
; ">" AND READS A LINE.  IF THE LINE STARTS WITH A NON-ZERO
; NUMBER, THIS NUMBER IS THE LINE NUMBER.  THE LINE NUMBER
; (IN 16 BIT BINARY) AND THE REST OF THE LINE (INCLUDING CR)
; IS STORED IN THE MEMORY.  IF A LINE WITH THE SAME LINE
; NUMBER IS ALREADY THERE, IT IS REPLACED BY THE NEW ONE.  IF
; THE REST OF THE LINE CONSISTS OF A CR ONLY, IT IS NOT STORED
; AND ANY EXISTING LINE WITH THE SAME LINE NUMBER IS DELETED.
;
; AFTER A LINE IS INSERTED, REPLACED, OR DELETED, THE PROGRAM
; LOOPS BACK AND ASKS FOR ANOTHER LINE.  THIS LOOP WILL BE
; TERMINATED WHEN IT READS A LINE WITH ZERO OR NO LINE
; NUMBER; AND CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO "DIRECT".
;
; TINY BASIC PROGRAM SAVE AREA STARTS AT THE MEMORY LOCATION
; LABELED "TXTBGN" AND ENDS AT "TXTEND".  WE ALWAYS FILL THIS
; AREA STARTING AT "TXTBGN", THE UNFILLED PORTION IS POINTED
; BY THE CONTENT OF A MEMORY LOCATION LABELED "TXTUNF".
;
; THE MEMORY LOCATION "CURRNT" POINTS TO THE LINE NUMBER
; THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING INTERPRETED.  WHILE WE ARE IN
; THIS LOOP OR WHILE WE ARE INTERPRETING A DIRECT COMMAND
; (SEE NEXT SECTION). "CURRNT" SHOULD POINT TO A 0.

; *** REM *** IF *** INPUT *** & LET (& DEFLT) ***
;
; 'REM' CAN BE FOLLOWED BY ANYTHING AND IS IGNORED BY TBI.
; TBI TREATS IT LIKE AN 'IF' WITH A FALSE CONDITION.
;
; 'IF' IS FOLLOWED BY AN EXPR. AS A CONDITION AND ONE OR MORE
; COMMANDS (INCLUDING OTHER 'IF'S) SEPERATED BY SEMI-COLONS.
; NOTE THAT THE WORD 'THEN' IS NOT USED.  TBI EVALUATES THE
; EXPR. IF IT IS NON-ZERO, EXECUTION CONTINUES.  IF THE
; EXPR. IS ZERO, THE COMMANDS THAT FOLLOWS ARE IGNORED AND
; EXECUTION CONTINUES AT THE NEXT LINE.
;
; 'INPUT' COMMAND IS LIKE THE 'PRINT' COMMAND, AND IS FOLLOWED
; BY A LIST OF ITEMS.  IF THE ITEM IS A STRING IN SINGLE OR
; DOUBLE QUOTES, OR IS A BACK-ARROW, IT HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS
; IN 'PRINT'.  IF AN ITEM IS A VARIABLE, THIS VARIABLE NAME IS
; PRINTED OUT FOLLOWED BY A COLON.  THEN TBI WAITS FOR AN
; EXPR. TO BE TYPED IN.  THE VARIABLE IS THEN SET TO THE
; VALUE OF THIS EXPR.  IF THE VARIABLE IS PROCEDED BY A STRING
; (AGAIN IN SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTES), THE STRING WILL BE
; PRINTED FOLLOWED BY A COLON.  TBI THEN WAITS FOR INPUT EXPR.
; AND SET THE VARIABLE TO THE VALUE OF THE EXPR.
;
; IF THE INPUT EXPR. IS INVALID, TBI WILL PRINT "WHAT?",
; "HOW?" OR "SORRY" AND REPRINT THE PROMPT AND REDO THE INPUT.
; THE EXECUTION WILL NOT TERMINATE UNLESS YOU TYPE CONTROL-C.
; THIS IS HANDLED IN 'INPERR'.
;
; 'LET' IS FOLLOWED BY A LIST OF ITEMS SEPERATED BY COMMAS.
; EACH ITEM CONSISTS OF A VARIABLE, AN EQUAL SIGN, AND AN EXPR.
; TBI EVALUATES THE EXPR. AND SET THE VARIABLE TO THAT VALUE.
; TBI WILL ALSO HANDLE 'LET' COMMAND WITHOUT THE WORD 'LET'.
; THIS IS DONE BY 'DEFLT'.

; *** PRTSTG *** QTSTG *** PRTNUM *** & PRTLN ***
;
; 'PRTSTG' PRINTS A STRING POINTED BY DE.  IT STOPS PRINTING
; AND RETURNS TO CALLER WHEN EITHER A CR IS PRINTED OR WHEN
; THE NEXT BYTE IS THE SAME AS WHAT WAS IN A (GIVEN BY THE
; CALLER).  OLD A IS STORED IN B, OLD B IS LOST.
;
; 'QTSTG' LOOKS FOR A BACK-ARROW, SINGLE QUOTE, OR DOUBLE
; QUOTE.  IF NONE OF THESE, RETURN TO CALLER.  IF BACK-ARROW,
; OUTPUT A CR WITHOUT A LF.  IF SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTE, PRINT
; THE STRING IN THE QUOTE AND DEMANDS A MATCHING UNQUOTE.
; AFTER THE PRINTING THE NEXT 3 BYTES OF THE CALLER IS SKIPPED
; OVER (USUALLY A JUMP INSTRUCTION.
;
; 'PRTNUM' PRINTS THE NUMBER IN HL.  LEADING BLANKS ARE ADDED
; IF NEEDED TO PAD THE NUMBER OF SPACES TO THE NUMBER IN C.
; HOWEVER, IF THE NUMBER OF DIGITS IS LARGER THAN THE # IN
; C, ALL DIGITS ARE PRINTED ANYWAY.  NEGATIVE SIGN IS ALSO
; PRINTED AND COUNTED IN, POSITIVE SIGN IS NOT.
;
; 'PRTLN' PRINTS A SAVED TEXT LINE WITH LINE # AND ALL.
